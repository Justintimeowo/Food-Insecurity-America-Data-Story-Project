# Food Insecurity America Data Story Project

## Assignment Overview

Select a contemporary challenge related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Find the relevant data, perform exploratory data analysis and present this data in an insightful and coherent manner. Utilise research and other information to give an evidence-based recommendation to the identified challenge.
There are four components

1. Choosing the challenge
2. Data Collection and Data Visualisation
3. Writing a Wrong: Misinformation
4. Making the Case: Recommendation

### Choosing the challenge

The topic I chose explores how the Covid-19 pandemic has shifted consumer access and availability to food, impacting food security concerns. Indeed, how might the US government ensure all consumers have equal access to food that is nutritious and sustainable all year around. This directly relates to three SDGs:

- **Goal 2.1**: By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round
- **Goal 8.4**: : Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production, with developed countries taking the lead
- **Goal 2.c**: Adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility

### Data Collection, Analysis, and Visualisations

Utilised a variety of data sources in the US. This includes data collected from the United States Department of Agrigulture (USDA), US Census, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis.

Data cleaning, analysis, and visualisations was predominantly done in RStudio. A variety of outstanding data visualisations were utilised such as time series graphs, scatter plots, bar graphs, area graphs, as well as an interactive heatmap I created in RStudio.

### Wwriting a Wrong: Misinformation

It is very easy to find misinformation online, particularly surrounding statistics and data visualisations. Required to find a piece of misinformation or opposiing perspective, assess its merits and create an opposing counter-argument.

### Making the Case: Recommendations

Summarise all components, research and findings into a video presentation and make data-driven recommendations for the appropriate target audience.

## Key Achievements

This data story project has allowed me to explore the complexity of data within the world around us and be able to communicate data through creating powerful visualisations

My data story project was reviewed by Dr Fei Huang and achieved a **High Distinction mark of 96**.
